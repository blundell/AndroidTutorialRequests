### Solution

[blog.blundell-apps.com/activity-to-complete-a-form-or-continue](http://blog.blundell-apps.com/a-simple-activity-to-complete-a-form-or-continue/)

An initial activity that detects if the form has been filled in. 
If it has it sends straight to the second screen (main)
else it sends them to the form to fill in (sign up).
