Good Day

Thanks for all the tutorials they are great, can you help me. 
Iâ€™m new to app development and would like to know if there is a way to have a app, when it starts up en it sees that 
you have not fulled in a form that it directs you to that form but if you already fulledin that for it directs you to page 2 hope this helps. 
if not let me know and I will explain in more detail


### Solution

An initial activity that detects if the form has been filled in. If it has it redirects straight to the second screen (main)
else is redirects them to the form to fill in (sign up).
